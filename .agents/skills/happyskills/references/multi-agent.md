# Multi-Agent Support

HappySkills supports installing skills across multiple AI coding agents simultaneously. When you install a skill, HappySkills automatically detects which AI agents are available on your system and links the skill to all of them.

## Where Physical Skill Files Live

**The single source of truth for all skill files is always the canonical `.agents/skills/` directory:**

| Scope | Physical location (source of truth) |
|---|---|
| Project-level | `<project>/.agents/skills/` |
| Global | `~/.agents/skills/` |

Every agent directory (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/`, etc.) contains **only symlinks** pointing back to `.agents/skills/`. No agent is special — they all work the same way.

The lock file (`skills-lock.json`) exclusively tracks the canonical location. It has no knowledge of symlinks or agent directories.

**Key implications:**
- To find the real files for any skill, always look in `.agents/skills/`
- Deleting a file from `.agents/skills/` breaks all agent symlinks
- Editing a file in `.agents/skills/` instantly propagates to all linked agents
- The `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc. directories should never be edited directly — they are derived from the canonical location

---

## How It Works

1. **Canonical location** — HappySkills downloads, extracts, and writes physical skill files exclusively to `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.agents/skills/` (global). No agent directory ever receives physical files directly.
2. **Detection** — HappySkills checks for the existence of `.<agent>/skills/` in the relevant scope (project root for project installs, home dir for global installs). The `.<agent>/skills/` subfolder is the unambiguous signal — it is only ever created by the CLI itself, never by the agent. This is deliberately tighter than checking for the bare `.<agent>/` folder, which agents create for their own settings, history, and sessions regardless of skill configuration.
3. **Symlink linking** — For each detected agent, HappySkills creates a symlink from that agent's skills directory to the canonical copy in `.agents/skills/`. This means one physical copy serves all agents, and updates propagate instantly.
4. **Uninstall cleanup** — When you uninstall a skill, HappySkills removes the physical files from `.agents/skills/` and cleans up all symlinks from every agent directory.

## Supported Agents

HappySkills supports 8 AI coding agents out of the box:

| Agent | ID | Project Detection | Home Detection | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `<project>/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `<project>/.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Windsurf | `windsurf` | `<project>/.windsurf/skills/` | `~/.windsurf/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `codex` | `<project>/.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot` | `<project>/.github/skills/` | `~/.github/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Aider | `aider` | `<project>/.aider/skills/` | `~/.aider/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Cline | `cline` | `<project>/.cline/skills/` | `~/.cline/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |
| Roo Code | `roo` | `<project>/.roo/skills/` | `~/.roo/skills/` | Symlinks to `.agents/skills/` |

All agents are equal — each receives a symlink from the canonical `.agents/skills/` directory. No agent stores physical files. Detection looks for `<agent>/skills/`, not the bare `.<agent>/` folder, because `.<agent>/skills/` is the only path that's exclusively a HappySkills artifact.

## Per-Project Agent Configuration (`agents` command)

When the user wants to **configure which agents are linked for a single project** — e.g., "add Codex to this project so I can try it out" — use the `agents` command. This is the right tool when the decision is project-scoped, not machine-wide. The existence of `.<agent>/skills/` in the project root IS the project-level configuration; the command just creates and tears down those folders deliberately and mirrors any installed skills as symlinks.

```bash
# Show every supported agent + status here (configured / # of linked skills)
npx happyskills agents --json
npx happyskills agents list --json

# Add an agent to this project — creates .<agent>/skills/ and mirrors every
# currently-enabled installed skill into it as symlinks
npx happyskills agents add codex --json
npx happyskills agents add codex,cursor --json    # comma list
npx happyskills agents add codex cursor --json    # space list

# Remove an agent's skills folder from this project. Physical files in
# .agents/skills/ are untouched. The agent's other state (settings, history,
# sessions) is left alone.
npx happyskills agents remove codex --json

# Operate on the global scope (~/.<agent>/skills/) instead of project-local
npx happyskills agents add codex -g --json
```

**Disabled-state respect** — `agents add` only mirrors skills that are currently enabled (i.e., symlinks present in at least one other configured agent in the same scope). Skills the user previously disabled stay disabled. The response lists which skills were skipped and points at `enable`.

**When to use `agents` vs `config agents` vs `--agents` flag:**

| Surface | Scope | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `happyskills agents add\|remove\|list` | This project only | "I want Codex enabled here, but not on every project" — the project's `.<agent>/skills/` folders become the truth |
| `happyskills config agents <ids>` | User-global default | "Across all my projects, always link to Claude + Cursor unless the project says otherwise" |
| `--agents` flag | One command only | One-off override on a single install/uninstall |

The project-physical configuration **wins** over the user-global `config agents` default (see priority order below). That's the mechanic that makes the project-scoped decision stick across subsequent `install`/`update` calls.

---

## The --agents Flag

By default, HappySkills auto-detects which agents are installed and links to all of them. You can override this behavior:

**Target specific agents:**
```
npx happyskills install owner/name --agents claude,cursor -y --json
```

**Only Claude (disable linking to other agents):**
```
npx happyskills install owner/name --agents claude -y --json
```

**Set a permanent default via config (recommended):**
```
npx happyskills config agents claude                 # only Claude
npx happyskills config agents claude,cursor          # Claude + Cursor only
npx happyskills config agents --reset                # back to auto-detect
npx happyskills config agents --list                 # show all agents with status
```

Persists to `~/.config/happyskills/config.json`. No shell profile editing needed.

**Alternative: environment variable:**
```
export HAPPYSKILLS_AGENTS=claude          # only Claude
export HAPPYSKILLS_AGENTS=claude,cursor   # Claude + Cursor only
```

Add to `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` for persistence.

**Priority order (5 tiers, top wins):**
1. `--agents` flag (per-command override)
2. `HAPPYSKILLS_AGENTS` environment variable
3. **Project-physical** — any `.<agent>/skills/` that exists in the project root (project scope only). Managed via `happyskills agents add|remove` (above).
4. Config file (`~/.config/happyskills/config.json`)
5. Home-physical fallback — auto-detect from `~/.<agent>/skills/`

Tier 3 is the load-bearing change: once `.codex/skills/` exists in this project (because the user ran `happyskills agents add codex`), every subsequent `install`/`update` in this project includes Codex, regardless of the user-global `config agents` default.

## Commands That Support --agents

| Command | Multi-Agent Behavior |
|---|---|
| `install` | Links to detected agents after installing (respects disabled state — disabled skills are not re-linked) |
| `uninstall` | Removes symlinks from all agents |
| `update` | Re-links after updating (respects disabled state) |
| `setup` | Links the happyskills skill to detected agents |
| `enable` | Creates symlinks for specified skills in all detected agent folders |
| `disable` | Removes symlinks for specified skills from all agent folders |
| `agents add` | Creates `.<agent>/skills/` for the given agents and mirrors every enabled installed skill into it. Does not accept `--agents` itself — the agent ids ARE the positional arguments. |
| `agents remove` | Removes the CLI-managed symlinks from `.<agent>/skills/`. Folder is deleted if empty. The parent `.<agent>/` is never touched. |
| `agents list` | Read-only — shows which agents are configured in the current scope and how many skills are linked into each. |

## Enable / Disable Skills

Skills can be disabled without uninstalling them. Disabling removes the symlinks from agent folders while keeping the physical files in `.agents/skills/` and the lock file entry intact. This is useful when:

- You have too many skills and want to reduce context window pollution
- You want to temporarily hide a skill from agents without losing it
- You want to prevent accidental slash-command invocation of a skill you're not currently using

**How it works:**
- **Disable** removes symlinks from all agent folders (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.)
- **Enable** re-creates symlinks pointing back to `.agents/skills/`
- The canonical files and lock file are never modified — only symlinks change
- Disabled skills remain tracked in the lock file and can receive updates
- When a disabled skill is updated (via `install` or `update`), it stays disabled — the CLI captures the disabled state before updating and does not re-create symlinks

**Detection:** A skill is considered "enabled" if it has at least one symlink in any detected agent folder. A skill with no symlinks anywhere is "disabled". The `list` command shows an Enabled column indicating this state.

```
npx happyskills disable deploy-aws monitoring --json    # disable multiple skills
npx happyskills enable deploy-aws --json                # re-enable
npx happyskills list --all-scopes --json                # see enabled/disabled status (local + global)
```

## JSON Output

When skills are linked to agents, the install JSON response includes a `linked_agents` field:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "skill": "owner/name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "installed": [...],
    "linked_agents": ["claude", "cursor", "windsurf"]
  }
}
```

If `linked_agents` is empty or absent, no agents were detected.

---

## Fallback Behavior

- **Symlinks preferred** — Fast, zero disk overhead, updates propagate instantly.
- **Copy fallback** — If symlinks fail (e.g., Windows without Developer Mode), HappySkills falls back to a physical copy in the agent's directory. This is the only scenario where files exist outside `.agents/skills/`. Even in this case, the canonical copy in `.agents/skills/` remains the source of truth tracked by the lock file.
- **Non-fatal** — If linking to an agent fails, the canonical install in `.agents/skills/` still succeeds. A warning is printed.
- **Lock file unchanged** — The lock file (`skills-lock.json`) exclusively tracks the canonical location (`.agents/skills/`). It has no knowledge of symlinks or agent directories.

## Examples

**User has Claude + Cursor installed:**
```
$ npx happyskills install acme/deploy-aws -y
  Installed 1 package(s)
  Linked to: Claude Code, Cursor
```

**User has Claude + Cursor + Windsurf installed:**
```
$ npx happyskills install acme/deploy-aws -y
  Installed 1 package(s)
  Linked to: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf
```

**User only wants Claude:**
```
$ npx happyskills install acme/deploy-aws --agents claude -y
  Installed 1 package(s)
  Linked to: Claude Code
```
