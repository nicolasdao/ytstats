# Changelog

All notable changes to the Essentials kit are documented here.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `nicolasdao/second-opinion` — a pre-implementation audit of a delivered analysis and fix plan. It re-grounds each claim at primary sources, tests rival explanations for the same symptom, sweeps the proposed changes for side effects on adjacent features, and returns an UPHELD, AMENDED or OVERTURNED verdict. It implements nothing; the human decides what happens next.
- It pairs with `scrutinize` rather than duplicating it: Scrutinize scopes by diff and runs after the work is done, Second Opinion scopes by argument structure and runs before implementation begins. The two cover opposite ends of the same risk.
- Version strategy unchanged — always-latest (`*`), consistent with every other member.

### Changed
- Kit description and keywords updated to name the new member; README "What's Included" extended with a Second Opinion entry that spells out how it differs from Scrutinize.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `nicolasdao/session-status` — a manually-invoked session ledger. It answers the question a long-running session leaves ambiguous: has the work finished, is it waiting on something, or did it stop halfway? The output is one screen — a plain-English verdict, a single table separating what came from the original plan from what was added along the way, and a short list of what only the user can unblock.
- It earns a place among the essentials for the same reason the others do: it is cross-cutting and domain-independent. Any project worked on across more than one sitting has the problem it solves.
- Version strategy unchanged — always-latest (`*`), consistent with every other member.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Initial release of the Essentials kit.
- Bundles `nicolasdao/_kit-doc-essentials` (nested kit: project memory, specifications, git commits), `nicolasdao/reframe-last-answer`, and `nicolasdao/scrutinize`.
- Version strategy: always-latest (`*`) for every member.
